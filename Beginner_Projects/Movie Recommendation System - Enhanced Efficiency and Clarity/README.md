Overview
This README provides a summary of the changes and optimizations made to the Movie Recommendation System code. The original code was enhanced to improve performance, readability, and best coding practices.

Changes Made
1. File Paths 

Reason for Change: Specifying file paths as variables improves code portability and readability, making it easier to manage data file locations.


2. Data Preprocessing

Reason for Change: Removed the detailed data preprocessing code to allow users to add their own data preprocessing steps as needed.


3. Data Splitting

Reason for Change: In this optimization, the data was not split for training and testing, as indicated by the comment. Data splitting is typically done for larger datasets when model evaluation is necessary.

4. Recommendations Printing

Reason for Change: Improved code comments and clarity.

5. Additional Comments

Reason for Change: Added a comment section to encourage users to include additional code for analysis or visualization.

Conclusion
These optimizations were made to improve the code's readability, organization, and flexibility. Users can now easily adapt the code to their specific needs, and it follows best coding practices for maintainability.
