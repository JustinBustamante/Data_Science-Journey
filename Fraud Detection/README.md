Project Title: Fraud Detection with Random Forest Classifier

Description:

This project focuses on building a fraud detection model using a Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions within a dataset. Here's a breakdown of the key steps in this project:

Data Preparation: The project begins by loading a dataset from a CSV file and preparing it for analysis. The 'transaction_time' column is converted to datetime format, and additional time-related features ('hour' and 'day_of_week') are extracted.

Feature Transformation: To prepare the data for machine learning, a ColumnTransformer is used to standardize numerical features and perform one-hot encoding on categorical features. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training the model.

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set with an 80-20 split ratio. This allows for model training and evaluation on independent datasets.

Model Building: A Random Forest Classifier is chosen as the machine learning model for fraud detection. The classifier is initialized with 100 decision trees and trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing set. The project evaluates the model's performance using a confusion matrix and a classification report. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Dependencies:

Python
pandas
scikit-learn (sklearn)
Usage:

To replicate or use this project, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
Replace 'path_to_your_dataset.csv' with the actual path to your dataset in the code.
Run the code to preprocess the data, train the Random Forest Classifier, and evaluate the model's performance.
Customize and adapt the code to your specific dataset and requirements.
Note:

This project serves as a foundation for fraud detection tasks and can be extended and customized for different datasets and scenarios. It showcases the use of machine learning techniques for identifying fraudulent transactions.
