NBA Player and Team Performance Analysis
Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of NBA players' performance data. The aim is to uncover insights into individual player performances, team dynamics, and predictive modeling for future performances.

Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis contains NBA player statistics. It includes a variety of metrics such as points scored, rebounds, assists, steals, and more.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Primary programming language for analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning and clustering.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Key Components of the Analysis
Data Preprocessing
Conversion and Cleaning: Converted 'minutes played' from hh:mm:ss format to total minutes and handled missing values.
Feature Engineering: Calculated a simplified Player Efficiency Rating (PER) for each player.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted EDA to understand data distribution and relationships.
Created a correlation matrix to explore how different statistics interact with each other.
Player Clustering
Implemented K-Means clustering to group players into 5 distinct clusters based on performance metrics.
Standardized features before clustering to ensure equal weightage.
Predictive Modeling
Developed a linear regression model to predict a player's points based on various performance indicators.
Evaluated the model using mean squared error (MSE).
Visualizations
Generated several visualizations, including:
Correlation matrix heatmap.
PCA-based scatter plot for player clusters.
Scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted player points.
Key Findings
Player Clustering: Identified distinct playing styles and roles within teams.
Predictive Model Performance: The linear regression model showed reasonable accuracy in predicting player points.
Correlation Insights: Strong correlations observed between related performance metrics.
Implications
The analysis provides valuable insights for team strategy formulation and player recruitment.
It helps in understanding the impact of various factors on player performance.
The visualizations and findings can enhance fan engagement and understanding of the game.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates data preprocessing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization skills. It offers a comprehensive understanding of NBA player and team performances, providing a basis for further analysis and application.
