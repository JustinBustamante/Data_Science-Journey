In this project, we aimed to analyze real estate sales data to identify seasonal patterns, long-term trends, and to forecast future trends. Here are the key takeaways:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The data from multiple years was successfully cleaned and merged. We handled missing values and converted data types where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted an initial EDA to understand the distribution of sale prices, the volume of sales over time, and other key metrics. This helped us identify seasonality and trends in the data.

Time Series Decomposition: We decomposed the time series data to isolate the seasonal and trend components, which provided valuable insights into the cyclical nature of property sales.

SARIMA Model: We employed a Seasonal ARIMA model to forecast property sale prices for the next 12 months. The model captured the seasonality effectively and provided a reasonable forecast.

Forecast Insights: The forecast suggests a continuation of the current trends and seasonality. This information can be valuable for various stakeholders including investors, real estate agents, and policy makers.

Future Work: Further analysis could include testing more advanced models, conducting anomaly detection, and performing a more granular analysis by property type or location.

This project demonstrates a structured approach to time series analysis and provides a foundation for more complex analyses in the future.
