Google Stock Price Prediction Analysis
This project involves analyzing and predicting Google's stock prices using historical data. The primary focus is on applying a linear regression model to forecast future stock prices based on past data.

Project Overview
The objective is to explore time series data of Google's stock prices and predict future prices using machine learning. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

Data Description
The dataset contains historical stock price data of Google, including attributes like Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. The key attribute used for prediction is the 'Close' price.

Analysis Steps
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The data is loaded and the 'Date' column is converted to datetime format.
The 'Date' column is set as the index of the dataframe.
Feature Engineering:

Lag features and moving averages are created to capture temporal patterns in the data.
A 1-day lag of the closing price and a 7-day moving average of the closing price are used as features.
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets based on a chronological order, ensuring the model is trained on earlier data and tested on more recent data.
Model Training and Prediction:

A Linear Regression model is used for forecasting stock prices.
The model is trained on the training set and used to make predictions on the test set.
Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.
RMSE provides a measure of how accurately the model predicts the response.
Visualization:

A plot is created to compare the actual vs. predicted stock prices, providing a visual representation of the model's performance.
Results
The model achieved an RMSE of approximately

 , indicating a very close match between the predicted and actual values.
However, such high accuracy is unusual in stock price predictions and might suggest overfitting or data-specific anomalies.
Key Considerations
The analysis primarily serves as an introductory exploration into time series forecasting and may require further refinement for practical applications.
Additional features, more complex models, and consideration of external factors like market trends and economic indicators can enhance the model's effectiveness.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
