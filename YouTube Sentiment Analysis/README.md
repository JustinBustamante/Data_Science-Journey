# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This sentiment analysis project is part of my data science journey, demonstrating my skills in natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as reviews, tweets, or customer feedback.

In this project, I applied various NLP techniques and machine learning models to analyze sentiment in text data. The goal was to classify text as either positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The project used a dataset of [describe your dataset source, size, and context].

## Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: I performed extensive data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and removing stopwords and special characters to prepare the text data for analysis.

- **Feature Extraction**: I employed techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent text as numerical features.

- **Model Selection**: I experimented with various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest and XGBoost) to build sentiment classification models.

- **Model Evaluation**: I assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also conducted cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.
